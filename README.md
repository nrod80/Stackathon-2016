# Stackathon-2016
In this casual four day hackathon: 

- As a warm up, I created an extremely simple learning algorithm for the cartpole environment.

- I implemented a deep deterministic policy gradient with a neural network for the OpenAI gym pendulum environment.

- I (fruitlessly) attempted to extend the DDPG to the humanoid environment. (the result is quite funny if you run it).

This project marks my first experience with TensorFlow, though I had previous implemented neural networks in other languages.
