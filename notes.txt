What is OpenAI Gym?
Why is it cool?

Ex 1: Cartpole
  -Naive implementation
  -Guess and Check
  -Really easy to guess correctly

Ex2: Pendulum
  -Use a multi-layered neural network
  -Actor-Critic Model with target neworks
    -The actor determines the action
    -The critic determines the value
    -Replay Buffer w/ minibatches to update the nerworks
  -Takes some time to learn, but definitely gets there
  -Cool to see development from infant to adult

Ex3: Humanoid
  -Did not work
  -Funny to watch my failures





What did I learn?:
  -TensorFlow / Python
  -Learned that I am not the guy from Ex Machina
